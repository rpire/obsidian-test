I want to do some tests using Git in Obsidian. What if I do some changes here.

## Result

Well... I guess we can say that implementing Obsidian and Git together was a success. Now people can clone repositories using git and run them with Obsidian. However, I am not liking the Git plugin too much... I guess it's something related to how it will be updated in GitHub? I don't know... I'll see other alternatives later.
